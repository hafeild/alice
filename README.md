# Alice
A database of tools (and other things) for the digital liberal arts.

## Purpose
The goal of the Alice database is to provide a system for curating information
regarding tools and their application in the digital liberal arts.
It allows the tracking of the following verticals:

  * analyses/methods (e.g., network diagramming)
  * software tools (e.g., NodeXL)
  * datasets (e.g., a set of labeled Tweets)
  * projects (e.g., performing network analysis using NodeXL over labeled Tweets)

Storing this data is only part of Alice's goal. The mission critical 
functionality includes:

  * easily searchable, including advanced search operations
  * easily browsable for casual discovery

With these verticals and information discovery goals met, users can find and
share tools, methods, datasets, and examples of how to use them.
