Alice Account Permission Change

Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Your permissions for Alice (<%= root_url %>) have changed. 

  New permission level: <%= @user.permission_level %>
  <% if not @user.permission_level_granted_by.nil? %>
  Granted by:           <%= @user.permission_level_granted_by.username %>
  <% end %>
  
<% if @user.permission_level == "admin" %>

As an admin, you will now be able to change permissions of other users. You will
be notified via email of permission requests made by users and will have the
opportunity to review those requests. Admin options are available at the bottom
of the users menu in the upper right corner of any Alice page.

<% elsif @user.permission_level == "editor" %>
As an editor, you will be allowed to create new content pages and edit existing
ones. To add new pages, use the options in the users menu in the upper right
corner of any Alice page, or use the "Add a ..." button at the top of any
vertical listing page. Editing options will automatically appear on all content
pages.
<% else %>
As a viewer, you will be able to view content across the site.
<% end %>

Thanks,
The Alice team
<%= root_url %>
